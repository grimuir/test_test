Checking out Github,

not getting very far

but the princples would remain the same

test test

what what


here are a few changes that you should have a look at. 

perhaps this is too complicated. perhaps just to use dreamweaver for SVC would be a better idea?

So then, would we have to have the dreamweaver local copy work on Github and then any changes would be picked up by Github which would then send it off to the server?

so what exactly is a branch then? I thought they could be actual different repositories or at least different versions of the same file?

Ok so this is on the new branch. now the new branch is something of a new thing - it delivers new content while also allowing for changes and differences betweent the file.s
