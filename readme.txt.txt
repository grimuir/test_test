hi there 
this is just a test document to see the power of the github interface. I don't think we would use github as you 
have to use GitHub enterprise in order to not publish on the internet. 


But you know, there are other ways to commit changes to a repository. I just have to find out if there is a way to merge certain files together


thanks
Gary
